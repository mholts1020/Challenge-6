Overview of the Project
This project looks at San Francisco housing data in CSV files. one with the number housing units per year(2010-2016), one with the coordinates (latitude/longitude) of different neighborhoods, and one with the number of housing units, average sale price by square feet, and average rental prices. WE used this data to look at trends and to advise on opportunities in investment and arbitrage accross the market.
